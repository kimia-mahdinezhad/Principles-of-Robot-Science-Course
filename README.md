# Principles of Robot Science Course
#### This repository is dedicated to the course I took at my university, and it contains all the class homework, laboratory assignments, and projects I worked on during the course.

## Course Overview

Throughout the course, I explored a wide range of topics related to robot science. Here's a brief overview of the subjects that the course covered:

- **Manipulators and Mobile Robots:** Gained a fundamental understanding of both manipulators and mobile robots, which are key components in the field of robotics.

- **Kinematics:** Delved into forward, instantaneous, and inverse kinematics, as well as Jacobian matrices, providing insights into how robots move and are controlled.

- **Trajectory Generation:** Learned how to generate trajectories for robots, a crucial aspect of robot control and planning.

- **Locomotion Concepts:** This section introduced me to the various locomotion concepts used in mobile robotics.

- **Mobile Robot Kinematics:** Explored kinematics specifically related to mobile robots, understanding how they navigate and move.

- **Sensors:** Sensors are vital in robotics, and studied their types and applications.

- **Perception:** Delved into perception, which plays a significant role in allowing robots to interact with their environment.

- **Actuators:** Understanding actuators helped grasp how robots physically interact with the world.

- **Motion Planning:** This topic is essential for enabling robots to navigate in complex environments and reach their goals.

## Tools and Software

In addition to the theoretical concepts, I also gained practical experience with various robotics tools and software, including:

- **ROS 1/2:** The Robot Operating System, an essential platform for robot development and control.

- **Gazebo Ignition:** An open-source simulation application.

- **MoveIt:** A popular software framework for motion planning and manipulation.

- **Navigation Stack:** Used for robot navigation and path planning.

- **2D & 3D Mapping:** Explored mapping techniques, including SLAM Toolbox and RTABMap, which are critical for robot localization and mapping in 2D and 3D environments.

## Repository Structure

- **Slides:** The course slides are available in this section, providing a quick reference to the course material.

- **Homework:** Each folder corresponds to a specific homework assignment. Inside each folder, you will find the related files and a README file describing the task.

- **Laboratory Assignments:** Similar to the homework, the laboratory assignments have their own folders with relevant files and READMEs for guidance.

- **Projects:** This section contains the eddiebot project's phases 0 and 1 that I worked on during this course. The full project documentation and files can be found in [my eddiebot repository](https://github.com/kimia-mahdinezhad/Eddiebot).
